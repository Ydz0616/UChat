## From Milestone 4:
Vedarsh added feature to reveal true identity to further connect with chatting partner. Requires consent from both parties to reveal information.
Vincent worked on adding "shake" feature for searching for a random online chatting partner. He did a little bit of refactoring. Just a little bit.
Phong improved UI and focused on polishing code. 
Yuandong implemented full-text search, pull-down to refresh, and online detection to see if another user is active on the app.
Stephon implemented a refined reporting feature and developer contact. He also helped implement notifications to local device (smartphone). Yuandong and Stephon both helped to implement conflict handling if two users want to chat at the same time.

You can find most of our code implementations in the UChat/app directory of the CODE.zip file
